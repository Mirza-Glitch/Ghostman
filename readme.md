Acknowledgement 👩‍💻
--------
Ghostman for Acode is a friendly adaptation of the original Ghostman React app by a talented developer on GitHub, check out the original ReactJs code [here](https://github.com/zakaria-tl/ghostman). Special thanks to [legendsabbir](https://telegram.me/legendSabbir) for helping me understand on how to add an icon, and how to create an acode page in Acode. I brought them together to make this plugin happen!

_NOTE:_ I took the original React app and transformed it into this spooky-smooth Acode plugin, so you can enjoy API testing right within your favorite editor.
